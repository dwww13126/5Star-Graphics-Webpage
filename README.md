# 5_Star_Graphics_Webpage

Ongoing volunteer project I am working on to create a new website for the Waikato print business "5Star Graphics". Design is responsive with a Mobile 1st, Desktop 2nd approach (As per the instructions of the client). Commits will be made following feature additions, improvements and content changes to provide the client with the most up-to-date version of the site through "Github Pages". Changes will be made throughout the development following feedback given during meetings with the client.
